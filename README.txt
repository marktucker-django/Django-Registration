This is an experimental fork of django-registration, implementing a
pluggable registration-backend system. You shouldn't be using this,
because it's likely to be any of A) non-functional, B) horrifically
backwards-incompatible, C) incomplete or D) all of the above.

For details on the planned implementation, see the notes on backends
for django-registration:
