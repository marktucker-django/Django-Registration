As of 19th September 2014 PyPi `handed over maintenance`_ of the "django-registration"
package to `Andrew Cutler`_. Prior to this date, the PyPi package was maintained by
`James Bennett`_.

If you have issues with the "django-registration" package then please `raise them here`_.

This is a fairly simple user-registration application for Django,
designed to make allowing user signups as painless as possible. It
requires a functional installation of Django 1.4 or newer, but has no
other dependencies.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "quickstart.rst" in the "docs/"
directory. Full documentation is also `available online`_
